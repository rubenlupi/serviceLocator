# DI && Service Locator && Light Inject  

Feel free to take a look of this implementation in c# of the Service Locator pattern. 

I've use the Light Inject nuget package to create the containers. The example is quite simple in order to make easy to understand the basics of this pattern.

For more information of Light Inject package you can visit http://www.lightinject.net/

Any comments would be highly appreciated.
